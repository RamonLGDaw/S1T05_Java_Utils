# Tasca S1.05. Java Utils

## Level 1

### Exercise 1

Create a class that lists the content of a directory alphabetically, where the directory is passed as a parameter.

### Exercise 2

Add functionality to the class from the previous exercise to list a directory tree, displaying the content of all its levels recursively. The content should be printed in alphabetical order within each level, indicating whether it is a directory (D) or a file (F), and also showing the last modification date.

### Exercise 3

Modify the previous exercise. Now, instead of displaying the result on the screen, save the result in a TXT file.

### Exercise 4

Add functionality to read any TXT file and display its content on the console.

### Exercise 5

Now, the program must serialize a Java object to a `.ser` file and then deserialize it.
