You're not alone — many developers feel the same way about Java. It’s often criticized for being:

    Verbose: Lots of boilerplate code just to do something simple.

    Heavy on syntax: Things like getters/setters, class declarations, etc., can make code unnecessarily long.

    More rigid: Especially compared to modern languages like Python, Kotlin, or JavaScript.

If you're finding Java frustrating, you might enjoy trying one of these:

    Kotlin: Interoperable with Java but much more concise and expressive.

    Python: Very beginner-friendly, clean syntax, and great for scripting or data science.

    JavaScript/TypeScript: Powerful for web development with more flexibility and less ceremony.
